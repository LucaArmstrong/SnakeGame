How to Play

Running the game:
When you start the game, the snake will be positioned in the center of the grid.

First Move: The game begins when you press any of the control keys (W, A, S, D).
Moving the Snake
Press the WASD keys to change the snake's direction.
The snake will move continuously in the direction it is currently facing.
The snake cannot reverse direction directly (e.g., moving up immediately after moving down is not allowed).

Eating Pellets
Pellets appear randomly on the grid.
Move the snake to the pellet's position to eat it.
Eating a pellet increases the snake's length by one unit.

Ending the Game
Winning: The game ends if the snake fills the entire grid.
Losing: The game ends if the snake collides with itself.
