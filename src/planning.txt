Main loop:
* will call the subroutines gathering all of them and using them in a single method

Snake representation:
* Store the grid in a 1D array of length area where area = height * width, basically the number

Grid for the game:
* bool snakeGrid[area];


Graphics Method:



Movement of the Snake Method:
* We will pass through the doIteration method which will force the snake to move grids every certain amount of time.
* If input w = index + 20, s - 20, a -1, d+1 "This is just an exmaple of how the snake would move"
- if the snake "eats" a pellet then the snake grows in size by 1


Snake eating pellet method:
* Pass through the POSITION of the snake
* A while loop when snake head coordinates = to the coordinates of the pellet -> increase the size snake +1
* As the snake = snake + 1 increase the score and speed of snake.

Snake moving method:
* pass through the DOITERATION method
* With each iteration the snake moves up a coordinate
* Then each iteration, the snake will be moved forward by one in the same direction it is currently facing
while loops checks for movement, if there is no movement, the back square of the snake will be truncuated
* and a new square for the head of the snake would placed in the cordinate above where it currently is,
and if there is movement, the new head of the square would be placed in the cordinate into the direction
of where the arrow is


Position method:
* Is a class for storing and x and y pair representing some position on the game grid


doIteration method?
- need to store a direction the snake is currently moving in
- need to get the input for any new direction
